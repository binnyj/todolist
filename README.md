# todolist

An academic to-do list that is personalized to my needs. This to-do list has
the feature where you can add the estimated duration of each task and from there
the to do list will let you know which tasks to prioritize based on due date and
duration of task.

You add a task by clicking on the '+ Add Task button' at the bottom.

- If a task is yellow, then you are running out of time to complete the task.
- If a task is red, then the task is overdue
